- 👋 Hi, I’m @PapaDonUSA.  My young friends sometimes calls me Papa Don.  But Don is just fine.
- 👀 I’m interested in electronics, IC's and MCU's.
- 🌱 I’m a newbie to electronics.  But I have experience in coding in VB.net.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on programming MCU's.
- 📫 You can reach me directly at donaldcwilson@att.net
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was blessed to be gifted musically. I play guitar, bass guitar and piano/keyboards. While my music reading skills aren't very good, I can listen to a song and play it fairly quickly.
